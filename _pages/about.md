I am working as a Bioinformatician in The Walter Lab located in School of Medicine,Washington University in St Louis. Recently I completed Master’s in Bioinformatics from School of Informatics and Computing Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis Indiana. Previously I finished my Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology from the University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India and followed that with a Master’s in Biotechnology from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), Melbourne, Australia. My research interests are inclined towards comprehending the role of RNA binding proteins in eukaryotes and metagenomics (microbiome) analyses.

Currently The Walter Lab focuses on discovery and characterization of gene mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the long term goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms that control abnormal hematopoiesis (including hematopoietic stem cells).
